    <p>Thanks for playing my silly guessing game.  Did you find it to be fun or annoying?  Here is a bit of background about myself. I enjoy learning to code but I have no prior coding experience.  I love spending the weekend outdoor with my husband and my two sons.  Of course my dad is not Bruce Lee and I grew up with 3 older brothers.  Ironically, majority of my brothers have daughters. Therefore, I now have 5 nieces.  My biggest fear in life is snake.  If I have enough money, I would love to travel around the world, especially to tropical places.  That should give you a bit of a background about me and my family.  
    </p>

    <h2>Below are the questions which I asked you to guess during the game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Question 1: Do you think I have any coding experience?</li> 
      <li>Question 2: I am very tall, do you think I am over 6 feet tall?</li>
      <li>Question 3: Do I have any sisters? </li>
      <li>Quesiton 4: If I told you my dad is Bruce Lee, would you believe me?</li>
      <li>Question 5: Lastly, do you think I can become a software developer in the future?</li>
      <li>Question 6: Please guess how many nieces I have?</li>
      <li>Question 7: Can you guess one of the 5 cities in the U.S. that I have visited?</li>
    </ul>
